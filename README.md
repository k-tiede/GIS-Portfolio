# GIS-Portfolio

# About me

I am a public policy and data analytics graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I will be graduating this May (May 2023) and hope to pursue a career in the intersection of analytics, research, and policy. Some of my previous course work includes Healthcare GIS, Methods of Policy Analysis: Future of Work, Applied Econometrics, Critical Analysis of Policy Research, and Data Science and Big Data. I have also spent several years working as a research assistant for various academics, particularly in the sphere of labor economics. These roles have consisted of gathering, analyzing, and describing data. I particularly enjoy working with data from the Census Bureau, as well as geographical data.

# What I hope to learn

I hope to learn more about how GIS can be used in policy spaces, especially in terms of analysis of policy. I also hope to strengthen my ability to scope projects and plan out what they will require. Additionally, I am very excited to learn more about spatial data science and recent developments in this area. In particular, I hope to gain a better understanding of kernel density equations and how to best perfrom statistical analysis on geographical data.
